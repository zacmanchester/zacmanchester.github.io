title: Article on Breakthrough Starshot in IEEE Spectrum
---

[An article](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/how-do-you-fly-to-alpha-centauri-in-just-20-years-ride-a-laser-beam) I wrote on [Breakthrough Starshot](http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3) for [IEEE Specturm](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/how-do-you-fly-to-alpha-centauri-in-just-20-years-ride-a-laser-beam) went online today. I tried to give some insight into the engineering challenges that the project faces without going too deep into technical details. A very challenging and exciting journey lies ahead, and I'm very excited to be a part of it!
