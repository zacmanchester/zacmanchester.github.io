title: Harvard Observatory Night
---

Last night [Blakesley Burkhart](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~bburkhar/Home.html) and I gave a talk on the Breakthrough Starshot project at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) [Observatory Night](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/publicevents). This is a really great monthly event that is free and open to the public. I highly recommend checking it out if you're in the Boston area. Here's a video of the talk:
