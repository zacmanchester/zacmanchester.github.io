title: This Week's Economist

I was featured in [this week's issue of The Economist](http://www.economist.com/printedition/2016-08-27), which focused on space. Here's [the full article](http://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2016-25-08/space-2016) by [Oliver Morton](https://twitter.com/eaterofsun), and here is [the section about me](http://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2016-25-08/space-2016#Panel01). This issue also had an [article](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21705825-new-discoveries-intelligent-devices-and-irrepressible-dreamers-are-once-again-making-space) on the recent announcement of a [new planet discovered around Proxima Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b), which has very exciting implications for [another project I'm involved in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Starshot).
