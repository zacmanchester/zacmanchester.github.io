title: WORLD.MINDS MOBILITY 2018
---

Last week I gave a talk on the Breakthrough Starshot project at the [WORLD.MINDS MOBILITY](http://www.worldminds.com/home/) conference in Zurich. This was a one-day conference of short talks (10~15 minutes) on a variety of topics having to do with transportation and mobility - everything from trains to [autonomous flying cars](https://lilium.com/) and [jet suits](https://gravity.co/). It was a nice change of pace for me and I had a great time. Here's a video of my talk:
