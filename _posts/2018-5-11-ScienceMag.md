A paper that I worked on with my friends [Jeff Lipton](https://jeffreyianlipton.wordpress.com/) and [Rob MacCurdy](http://robertmaccurdy.com/) was published in [Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/632)! This one was definitely outside of my usual area of expertise, but was a lot of fun to work on. Basically, Jeff and Rob (working with a few other people at MIT) figured out how to put together materials that can expand, contract, and lock into place, similar to how [keratin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin) and [collagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen) work in biological systems. I helped by working out the math to describe the motion and locking behavior using a little [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory). In the future, these materials could be used for all kinds of engineering applications, including medical devices, robotic actuators, and deployable structures for spacecraft.
