title: DLD 2018
---

This week I traveled to Munich for the 2018 [DLD conference](http://www.dld-conference.com/). DLD stands for "Digital Life Design," and the conference explores new ideas in technology and their implications for business, art, and society. I spoke on a panel called, "The hidden potential of remote sensing, space and data." The discussion mostly centered on how satellite data is used in Earth monitoring, environmental, and ecology applications, and featured speakers from the [World Wildlife Fund (WWF)](https://www.worldwildlife.org/), and [Cloudeo](https://www.cloudeo-ag.com/), a new startup renting satellite remote sensing data. Check out the video below:
