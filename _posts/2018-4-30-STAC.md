title: UC Berkeley Space Tech Symposium
---

This week I was invited to speak on a panel at the Space Tech Symposium put on by a student group at UC Berkeley called Space Technologies at Cal (STAC). The panel I was part of focused on spaceflight and spacecraft engineering in a university research environment. It was a great event that showcased a bunch of cool student projects, was well attended by people from local Bay Area space startups, and also featured a fantastic keynote talk by [Arial Waldman](http://arielwaldman.com/).
