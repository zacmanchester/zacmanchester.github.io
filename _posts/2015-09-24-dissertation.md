title: Ph.D. Dissertation

My Ph.D. dissertation just came in from the printer. It documents a lot of my work on [KickSat](http://kicksat.github.io/) over the past four or five years, along with some stuff on variational integrators, feedback control for flat spin recovery, and spacecraft inertia estimation. You can [read the PDF here](/docs/Zac_Manchester_PhD_Dissertation.pdf) if you're interested.

Thanks to everyone at Cornell and NASA Ames who helped me along the way!
