title: AIAA SciTech 2016 Plenary
---

I was recently invited to speak on a panel as part of the plenary series at the 2016 AIAA SciTech conference in San Diego. The topic of the discussion was, "Lessons learned from a half century of innovation in aerospace technology." It was a huge honor to be on stage with former Apollo astronaut Bill Anders, who flew around the moon on Apollo 8 and took [the famous "Earthrise" picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise).

I tried to bring a positive perspective on where new technologies are taking the aerospace industry, including the rise of small satellite startups and the faster pace of design itteration enabled by CAD software and rapid prototyping tools. Here's a video of the discussion:
