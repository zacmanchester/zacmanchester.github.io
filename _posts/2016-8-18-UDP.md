title: UDP Paper Accepted to CDC 2016
---

My advisor at Harvard, [Scott Kuindersma](http://scottk.seas.harvard.edu/), and I just had our paper ["Derivative-Free Trajectory Optimization with Unscented Dynamic Programming"](/docs/udp.pdf) accepted to the [2016 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control](http://cdc2016.ieeecss.org/). The paper describes a new trajectory optimization algorithm we developed that takes the classic [Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_dynamic_programming) and applies some ideas from the [Unscented Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Unscented_Kalman_filter) to eliminate the need for derivatives and improve performance. We're calling it Unscented Dynamic Programming. Here's an example I made for the paper that calculates a barrel-roll trajectory for an airplane using the least possible control effort:
