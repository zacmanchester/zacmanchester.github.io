title: Breakthrough Discuss Conference
---

I just got back from the 2017 [Breakthrough Discuss Conference](https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Events/DiscussConference) at Stanford. It was a fascinating couple of days hearing about the latest exoplanet discoveries from [the astronomers themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiry1bYILKs), as well as recent developments in [SETI](http://www.seti.org/) and the search for life outside our solar system. Many videos from the conference are being uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/breakthroughprize/videos) and I highly recommend [checking them out](https://www.youtube.com/user/breakthroughprize/videos). I gave a talk on the stability of laser-propelled sails for Starshot, and a photographer caught this great picture of me doing a little experiment:
