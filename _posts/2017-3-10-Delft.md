title: TU Delft Visit

I had the great pleasure of visiting the [aerospace engineering department at TU Delft](http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/en/) in the Netherlands for the past two days. In addition to learning about a lot of very cool research, I gave a seminar talk about my work on [KickSat](http://kicksat.io) and [Breakthrough Starshot](http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3). The talk was recorded and you can [watch it online here](https://collegerama.tudelft.nl/Mediasite/Play/e0093c40cc6f45be97d353a2471d125c1d).
