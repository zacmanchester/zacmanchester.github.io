title: How to Ride a Laser Beam
---

Today I gave a lunch talk at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) on some work I've been doing for the [Breakthrough Starshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Initiatives#Breakthrough_Starshot) project. In particular, I've been trying to figure out how to make sure the lightsail stays on the laser beam as it is accelerated. In the video below, I talk about some analysis on different beam and sail configurations and thier stability properties. You can also check out a [draft of the paper on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09506) for all of the gory mathematical details.
