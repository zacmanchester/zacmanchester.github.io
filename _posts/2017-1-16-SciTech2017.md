title: AIAA SciTech 2017
---

I just got back from the 2017 AIAA SciTech Conference in Grapevine, Texas. The conference was a great opportunity to learn about a whole bunch of interesting small satellite and UAV work going on around the world. I presented two papers: one on [spacecraft inertia estimation](http://zacmanchester.github.io/docs/Inertia_Estimation.pdf) that grew out of my PhD work on [KickSat](http://kicksat.io), and one on some new [micro aerial vehicle (MAV) perching](http://zacmanchester.github.io/docs/Morphing_Wing.pdf) work I'm doing in my postdoc at Harvard. The picture below shows the wind tunnel test rig I built to measure the aerodynamic coefficients ([lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_coefficient), [drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient), and [pitching moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitching_moment)) of our MAV prototypes. Check out the [papers](http://zacmanchester.github.io/publications/) and [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/zacmanchester) from my talks if you're interested.
