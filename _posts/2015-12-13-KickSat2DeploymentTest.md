title: KickSat-2 Deployment Test
---

Here's a test of the new deployment mechanism for KickSat-2. This mechanism was developed to meet more stringent safety requirements for the KickSat-2 mission. On KickSat-1, the mechanism was triggered by a single burn wire. On KickSat-2, we have two independent "inhibits" triggerend by two different burn wire circuits. The primary inhibit is a nylon screw that is threaded through the entire assembly. The secondary inhibit is a monofilament tie-down that is threaded through holes in the assembly and secured to the structure. Both the primary and secondary inhibits must be cut in order to trigger deployment. During the mission, the secondary tie-down would be cut first, followed by the primary. The following video shows the opposite - the nylon screw is cut first, followed by the tie-down - to demonstrate that everything works as it should.
