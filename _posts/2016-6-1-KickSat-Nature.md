title: KickSat Featured in Nature News
---

KickSat was featured in an [article in Nature News](http://www.nature.com/news/tiny-chipsat-spacecraft-set-for-first-flight-1.20006) today. Check it out! While it's unfortunate that [KickSat-2 is no longer launching on the OA-5 mission this July](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zacinaction/kicksat-your-personal-spacecraft-in-space/posts/1591078), I'm hopeful that we'll be manifested on another launch within a few months.
