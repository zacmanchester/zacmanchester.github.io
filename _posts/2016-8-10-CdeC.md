I spent the past week with an awesome organization called [Clubes de Ciencia](http://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/) teaching university and high school students in Xalapa, a small city in (and the capitol of) the state of Veracruz in Mexico. My "club" was called *ยก3, 2, 1 Despegue!* (*3, 2, 1, Liftoff!*), and we covered the basics of orbit mechanics, spacecraft design, and satelite communication. Two big highlights of the week (in addition to the Mexican food) were listening to signals from a CubeSat and launching a high altitude balloon, which eventually topped out at over 103,000 feet! Check out the footage of the launch with great views of the city of Xalapa:
