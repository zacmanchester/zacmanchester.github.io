I'm a researcher and aerospace engineer with broad interests in dynamics, control, estimation, and optimization. I'm especially interested in building spacecraft and unmanned aircraft that are smaller, smarter, and more agile, by taking advantage of advancements in embedded electronics and computation. I founded the [KickSat](http://kicksat.io) project in 2011 and I've worked on several small spacecraft missions.

Thanks for reading!
