Thanks for stopping by! I'm a researcher and aerospace engineer with broad interests in dynamics, control, estimation, and optimization. I'm especially interested in taking advantage of advancements in embedded electronics and computation to build spacecraft and unmanned aircraft that are smaller, smarter, and more agile. I founded the [KickSat project](http://kicksat.io) while I was a PhD student. I've also worked on unmanned aerial vehicles, commercial aerospace simulation software, and several small spacecraft missions. For more information, have a look at my [my CV](http://zacmanchester.github.io/docs/CV-Manchester-July2018.pdf).
