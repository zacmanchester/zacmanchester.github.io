title: About

I'm a researcher and aerospace engineer with broad interests in dynamics, control, estimation, and optimization. I'm especially interested in building spacecraft and unmanned aircraft that are smaller, smarter, and more agile, by taking advantage of advancements in embedded electronics and computation. I founded the [KickSat project](http://kicksat.io) in 2011. I've also worked on unmanned arial vehicles, commercial aerospace simulation software, and several small spacecraft missions.
